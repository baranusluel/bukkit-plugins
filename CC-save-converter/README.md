This tool changes old userdata files to new ones. It is based off of cybertiger's save-converter (https://github.com/cybertiger/save-converter).

The tool has been changed to convert usernames to UUIDs using data from a MySQL database instead of the Mojang servers.

Run it like this: "java -jar save-converter-2.0.jar <host> <database> <username> <password> <world to convert> <world to convert> <world to convert> ..."
