ChoiceFriends
=============

PLEASE ALTER AS NEEDED

The plugin would log UUID + Username and a flag that says "Online" True/False and what server they are logged into if True.

On Login and on Logout it would update the database

Player will be able to use the command "/friend add s4ndal" to add a friend to their friend list, when they do /friend list they should be able to view all their friends. 
It will be in this format:

&bChoiceFriends
&aUsername    Online      Server
&7Username    Offline

etc...

If s4ndal was in your friend list, you would get a notification when that player logs into the network or into a specific server.

‘&as4ndal has logged into SkyBlock’

Is there anyway for the plugin the server’s motd in the server.properties to get the server name?

There will also be a global chat function to the plugin.

Players will be able to "/cmsg username msg" and it will pm them the message.

Players should be able to "/chatroom create 'name' 'password'" and have "/chatroom invite username" When players do that it will inform them to use the command "/chatroom toggle" or "/crt" to toggle from normal inner server chat to ChoiceFriend chat.
