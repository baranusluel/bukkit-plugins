This tool changes old userdata files to new ones.

This tool has been changed; instead of converting usernames to UUIDs through mojang servers, it uses our own database instead.

Run it like this: "java -jar save-converter-2.0.jar <host> <database> <username> <password> <world to convert> <world to convert> <world to convert> ..."
