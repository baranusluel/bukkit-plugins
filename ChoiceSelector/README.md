This is a plugin that lets you create a server selector Menu, to be used in the Hub. It can also display how many players are in the servers, inside the menu.

It is fully configurable.

**Notes:**

* The value of "menu-size" should be a multiple of 9
* Place the information of the servers you want in the menu, into the config
* The names of the servers should be written the same way they were written in the bungeecord config.yml
