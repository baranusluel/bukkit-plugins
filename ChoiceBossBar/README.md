This plugin was made for the Hub, although feel free to use it for other servers on the network if needed. What it does is show configurable message(s) with the boss bar, with configurable intervals.

It doesn't jump back and forth like the previous one in the Hub. Also, the current message is added to a player on the join event, so they don't have to wait for the messages to be renewed (again, like the previous plugin in the Hub).
